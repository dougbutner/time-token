# This is a WIP 
I may not have time to flesh this out until spring 2021.

Go [here](https://github.com/dougbutner/web-4) for an overview of where we're going with this, or read the [Purple Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2JH9J73WjgZ9-cULJAzrYvZzyPSXEA_fdgt21lHnDc/preview) to learn about the first implementation of time tokens.

# Time Tokens
## A Conceptual Overview

A time token is a unit of cryptocurrency

Time Token hashes a layer above timestamp and faucets free token to everyone requesting for past 12 hours if no other faucet in that time. 

1. Faucet for any qualifying user
2. Time Units
3. One token per time unit
4. Faucet gives 1 token per time unit up to 1 full day, or other time unit when appropriate




# Examining These Points

 1. **Faucet for any qualifying user**

Individuality is required to build web 4, though hypothetically this system could be built for a specific sub unit of the population, like team members, where the user is given the account and the tokens, which the token's owner (a team leader) could mint tokens for each decision to be made, or, more in the spirit, allow each person to accrue infinite time tokens starting at the time they start at the company. Have election require each person to vote a certain amount, excluding those who had not worked there long enough, and



Time tokens must be distributed in a 1 token per time unit manner. This token may be indivisible (good for cases like voting for leaders, or yes and no). 



Time tokens can either be issued from the moment a user passes one unit on, or simply minted and spent at the users request. User would only be able to vote one toke (time unit) in that case, which may not even be noticeable 
Can user 


Time tokens are burnt when they are used, often transformed into another token that may identify the
